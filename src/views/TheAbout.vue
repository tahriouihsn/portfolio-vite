      I'm Aniket Kotal, an India based Vue.js developer/Student @ Parul
      University, with never-stopping love for learning new tech. I am
      specialising in Web Development with Vue.js, Express, MongoDB and Node.js.
      I am passionate about the Internet and how we can design beautiful looking
      interfaces with programming languages.

      I'm currently working on
      <LinkBtn link="https://scarletdynasty.vercel.app">Scarlet Dynasty</LinkBtn
      >, a website for my friend's team. I recently worked on
      <LinkBtn link="https://stust.vercel.app/">Stust</LinkBtn>, a fictional
      card designer. I am also learning GraphQL and UI/UX. Before this, I just
      used to design small projects from Frontend Mentor. It has helped me
      polish my web-development skills.

      I started learning about web-development in my early high-school, where I
      was introduced to HTML and CSS. I quickly started writing small webpages
      with simple HTML and little of CSS. After my high-school, I took some time
      to myself and explored the web development world more and found many
      frameworks. Out of all, I found my love for Vue.js. Since then, I've been
      mastering it, and with every new project I added a new tool, like
      TailwindCSS, Express and more.

      You can find my projects on my
      <LinkBtn link="https://github.com/mightykillrr">Github</LinkBtn> or on my
      <LinkBtn link="/">Portfolio</LinkBtn> page. I usually don't update my
      portfolio page but all my recent one's are on github.

      Outside of my worklife, I love to play Valorant and CS:GO, listening to
      Em. on Spotify, or just hanging out on Discord with my friends. You can
      follow along about my life on my

      post very rarely so you might not find many posts on either.
